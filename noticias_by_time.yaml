  - Título: Warner Bros. Discovery's Max launches sports tier
    Conteúdo: Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) launched a new sports tier on its Max service on Thursday as the media company tries to lure more users to its flagship platform in a hotly competitive environment for streaming.Max's new "Bleacher Report" add-on includes access to live games from the MLB, NHL, and NBA, in addition to other major sporting events like March Madness. Subscribers will also be able to access TNT's popular "Inside the NBA" studio program along with select international games.The package, which will be available for free until Feb. 29, 2024, will eventually cost Max subscribers an additional $9.99 a month."This will mark the first time that fans will have access on streaming platforms, in addition to linear, to WBD’s portfolio of premium live sports content, including more than 300 live games each year," the company said in a press release prior to the tier's debut.The company has also leaned on other types of live events like news. CNN Max, a 24/7 streaming news offering, launched as part of an open beta on Max at the end of September."We've always thought that news would be a big part of Max. Sports as well," Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich previously told Yahoo Finance. She explained live content creates various levels of "stickiness" that drives streaming consumption and keep users locked into the ecosystem.The launch comes as the company tries to make its streaming business more profitable. Marketing and launch costs related to Max, which debuted at the end of May, propelled a direct-to-consumer loss of $3 million in WBD's second quarter. That was a significant improvement compared to the $558 million loss in the year-ago period. Streaming losses reversed in the first quarter.On the company's earnings call, CEO David Zaslav said that "news and sports are important, they're differentiators, they're compelling, and they make these platforms come alive."The company also said then that it saw elevated churn following the debut of its Max streaming service, as customers with overlapping subscriptions to both Max and Discovery+ shed extra accounts.

  - Título: Big Tech Stocks Have Taken a Beating. The Case for Buying Them Now.
    Conteúdo: Big Tech stocks have finally stumbled. For longer-term investors, they look like flat-out buys.AppleMSFTAMZNNVDATSLA are down between 9% and 14% from their 2023 peaks, after having seen double-digit gains during the first seven months of the year. Alphabet (GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META), down 3% and 6%, respectively, have been hit less hard.Nothing goes up forever, and there are plenty of reasons for the declines, ranging from nosebleed valuations, the extent of their popularity, and the rise of the 10-year Treasury yield, which has jumped as high as 4.8% this past week, its highest level since 2007, from a summer bottom of about 3.7%.Enter the bull case. It starts with the fact that the rise in yields is likely to slow down from here. They just can’t keep rising at the same pace, particularly because they’re already reflecting the Federal Reserve’s plan to keep rates higher for longer. A drop in yields, of course, would lift tech stocks—and the entire stock market, for that matter—but even just a slower increase would be helpful.

  - Título: 'iPhone 15 update: Apple pushes new iOS 17 download to fix hot phones'
    Conteúdo: Andrew Griffin Apple has finally pushed an update to the new iPhone 15 that should stop it running hot.In recent days, some owners of new iPhone 15 models, as well as the Pro and Max, reported that the devices appeared to be much warmer to the touch than expected. It prompted worry that the new design and materials in the iPhone 15 had caused it to be worryingly hot.Last week, however, Apple finally broke its silence on the problem. It said that many new iPhones could run hot for normal reasons – because they are setting themselves up, for instance – but also because of flaw in the new system software.“We have also found a bug in iOS 17 that is impacting some users and will be addressed in a software update,” the company said in a statement to Forbes. “Another issue involves some recent updates to third-party apps that are causing them to overload the system. We’re working with these app developers on fixes that are in the process of rolling out.”As well as confirming that the issue could be fixed with a new update, Apple said that it would not throttle performance. Previous reports that the issue could be fixed with a new version of iOS 17 had led to fears that would bring slower processing in an attempt to reach cooler temperatures.Now that update has finally arrived, in the form of iOS 17.0.3. It is available now, and can be downloaded through the Settings app as usual.The new update also brings fixes for security bugs that could be used by hackers to gain access to the phone. One is thought to have been “actively exploited” already, meaning that the update is an urgent fix.

    Conteúdo: '3 Kate Park Fri, October 6, 2023 at 2:10 PM GMT-3South Korea’s telecommunication regulator, the Korea Communications Commission (KCC), said Friday that it plans to levy fines on Google and Apple, which could total up to $50.5 million, for violating the country’s in-app payment law.According to the KCC statement, the two Big Tech giants abused market dominance to force local app developers to use their in-app payment methods rather than competitors’ payment systems and unfairly delayed app reviews to enforce the specific billing system.The commission informed Google and Apple of the implementation of corrective measures to promote fair competition in the app store marketplace. The watchdog also mentioned in the statement that Apple discriminatorily charged commissions to domestic app developers in South Korea.The KCC will finalize the fines for Google and Apple, up to 47.6 billion won ($35.4 million) and 20.5 billion won, respectively, after collecting opinions from Google and Apple.The Korean watchdog launched its investigation into the case of three app stores -- Google, Apple and One Store, a local app store -- in August 2022 over potential violations of the country’s in-app payment rule that South Korea passed in 2021.In 2021, South Korea enacted a new telecommunication law that allows app developers to use third-party payment options for in-app purchases and bans app store operators from forcing them to use their own systems. Apple and Google agreed to abide by these rules. However, Apple asked developers targeting the South Korean App Store to submit a separate binary for using third-party purchasing systems in 2022.Earlier this year, South Korea’s Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) fined Alphabet’s Google 42.1 billion won (nearly $32 million) for blocking developers from releasing mobile video games on a Korean competitor platform called One Store.“We have continued to work closely with KCC to demonstrate how we are complying with the new law whilst ensuring that through our alternative billing, we continue to provide a safe and high-quality experience for all,” a spokesperson of Google told TechCrunch. “What KCC has shared today is the ‘pre-notice’ and we will carefully review and submit our response. Once the final written decision is shared with us we will carefully review to evaluate the next course of action.”Apple said it disagrees with KCCs latest announcement. “We disagree with the conclusion made by the KCC in their Examiners report, and believe the changes we have implemented to the App Store comply with the Telecommunications Business Act. As we have always done, we will continue to engage with the KCC to share our views,” Apple said in its statement.'

  - Título: 'Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It'
    Conteúdo: "Apple (AAPL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future. Over the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned -1.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -5.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, which Apple falls in, has lost 7.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction? While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making. Earnings Estimate Revisions Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.39 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4%. For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.05 points to a change of -1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.4%. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.58 indicates a change of +8.8% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple. The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: 12 Month EPS Revenue Growth Forecast While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth. In the case of Apple, the consensus sales estimate of $88.87 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -1.4%. The $382.65 billion and $405.34 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -3% and +5.9%, respectively. Last Reported Results and Surprise History Apple reported revenues of $81.8 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.4%. EPS of $1.26 for the same period compares with $1.20 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $81.36 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.54%. The EPS surprise was +5.88%. Over the last four quarters, Apple surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period. Valuation Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects. Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is. As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Apple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. Conclusion The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

  - Título: 'PayPal (PYPL) Strengthens Payment Solutions With Latest Move'
    Conteúdo: "Zacks Equity Research Thu, October 5, 2023 at 1:12 PM GMT-3 In this article PYPL +0.50% Watchlist Fair Value Estimateyahoo plus badge UndervaluedSee why AAPL +1.48% ANET +3.19% PayPal PYPL has bolstered its tie-up with Apple AAPL by introducing the option to add PayPal and Venmo credit or debit cards to Apple Wallet. By adding cards to Apple Wallet, PayPal and Venmo, customers can use Apple Pay on iPhone, iPad and Mac to make fast and convenient purchases in apps or on the web in Safari. Customers can now make in-store or online payments securely via Apple Pay with a simple tap of their iPhone or Apple Watch. Users can continue earning the same cashback and rewards with the new option. More precisely, they will earn a 2% cashback while making payments through Apple Pay using a PayPal Cashback Credit Card. Currently, the underlined option is available only for adding PayPal credit and debit cards to Apple Wallet. It will be available for PayPal Business Debit Card and Venmo credit or debit cards in the coming months. We note that the latest move is likely to strengthen the adoption of PayPal payment cards, thanks to the growing popularity of Apple Pay, Apple watch and iPhones. This, in turn, will likely accelerate PayPal’s transaction revenues in the days ahead, which in turn will drive its top-line growth. In second-quarter 2023, transaction revenues amounted to $6.6 billion (90% of net revenues), up 5% from the year-ago quarter’s level. For 2023, our model estimate for the same stands at $26.7 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 6% from 2022. PayPal Holdings, Inc. price-consensus-chart | PayPal Holdings, Inc. Quote Expanding Payment Solution Offerings Apart from its latest move, PayPal recently introduced Tap to Pay on Android for Venmo and Zettle users to empower small businesses with seamless payment options. It strengthened its payment solution offerings for small businesses by adding new features. The features allow small businesses to accept payments made through PayPal, credit and debit cards, digital wallets, Venmo, PayPal Pay Later and Apple Pay. The company’s Passkeys for Android devices, which deliver a secured log-in and password-free, safe payment experience, remain noteworthy. PayPal's subsidiary, Xoom, introduced Debit Card Deposit, which allows U.S. customers to conveniently and securely send money directly to friends and family’s eligible Visa debit cards. It is available in 25 countries. PayPal enables Venmo users to transfer cryptocurrencies to friends and family seamlessly. We note that the growing portfolio offerings will continue to drive PayPal’s customer momentum in the near term. Wrapping Up PayPal’s increasing interest in the expansion of its payment solution offerings has been playing a vital role in strengthening its presence in the booming online payment industry. Per a report from Statista, the digital payment market is expected to hit a transaction value of $9.46 trillion in 2023 and reach $14.78 trillion by 2027, registering a CAGR of 11.8% between 2023 and 2027. The growth prospects of the company in this promising market are likely to continue driving its financial performance in the near term. This is likely to aid the company in winning investors’ confidence in the days ahead. However, the company has been suffering from intensifying competition in the digital payment market, which poses a serious risk to its market position. Foreign exchange headwinds remain a concern. PYPL has lost 17.7% in the year-to-date period against the industry’s growth of 45.3%. Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider Currently, PayPal carries a Zacks Rank Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Asure Software ASUR and Arista Networks ANET.

  - Título: 'Where Will Apple Stock Be in 10 Years?'
    Conteúdo: "A special aspect of Apple is its ability to innovate and repackage existing technologies in innovative ways, which has helped it achieve a market capitalization of $1 trillion in 2018. Some notable examples include the iPod, which revolutionized the mp3 market in 2001, and the iPhone, which transformed the mobile phone industry in 2007. However, in 2023, Apple primarily relies on iPhone sales, which account for a significant portion of its revenue. The challenge for Apple is that the smartphone market has matured, making it difficult to introduce groundbreaking improvements. As a result, Apple has raised prices, with the most recent iPhone 15 starting at $799, compared to the initial iPhone's $499 price tag. While inflation plays a role in this price increase, it's uncommon for hardware platforms to become more expensive over time due to manufacturing efficiencies, technological advancements, and competition. Apple's brand and ecosystem, where its products work seamlessly together, help maintain strong demand. However, as prices rise and phone enhancements become more incremental, the tradition of upgrading phones every few years may become less relevant. While iPhones will remain a consistent source of revenue and profit, they may not be a significant growth driver. Fortunately, Apple's services segment is experiencing positive trends. Services encompass offerings like the Apple Store, iTunes, and Apple Pay, with a gross margin of 70.5%, nearly double that of Apple's hardware products. The services segment benefits from a substantial customer base, exceeding 2 billion devices, often equipped with Apple's services. Expanding into new services like Apple Business Essentials, an IT management package for small businesses, can further drive success. Looking ahead, artificial intelligence (AI) may play a pivotal role in Apple's growth strategy. While the company has focused on AI improvements for consumer-facing features like spell-check and photo recognition, it has yet to fully leverage AI's potential. Apple aims to introduce a partially self-driving car by 2026, incorporating AI technology such as machine learning and computer vision. This product could integrate seamlessly with Apple's ecosystem, particularly for users who already own Apple devices. In conclusion, Apple's valuation with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 26 is in line with the S&P 500 average. However, investors may want to see Apple explore new opportunities, potentially in AI and car manufacturing, before considering buying shares.

  - Título: 'Heres 1 Key Investing Metric Where Apple and Google Trounce the Other Stocks in the $1 Trillion Club'
    Conteúdo: "An underappreciated investing metric As the chart shows, Apple and Alphabet have much higher free cash flow (FCF) yields over the last 12 months than Amazon (AMZN 1.59%), Microsoft (MSFT 2.47%), and Nvidia (NVDA 2.40%). I think that free cash flow yield is a greatly underappreciated investing metric. Investment research company New Constructs (the source of the chart data) calculates free cash flow by subtracting a company's net working capital (excluding excess cash) and its change in fixed assets from its net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT). It then determines the FCF yield by dividing FCF by enterprise value (EV). Free cash flow provides an even better view of a company's financial shape than earnings do. Businesses can manipulate their earnings figures in several ways that they can't do with free cash flow. You'd expect a larger company to generate greater free cash flow than a smaller company would. That's where FCF yield is helpful. It allows investors to easily compare companies of different sizes. The greater the FCF yield is, the more attractively valued the company is. Why such a big gap in the $1 trillion club? It's not surprising that Apple and Alphabet sport solid FCF yields. But why is there such a big gap between the two leaders and the other members of the $1 trillion club? There's an easy answer with Amazon. The e-commerce and cloud services leader generated negative free cash flow in several recent quarters, due in part to its heavy investments in infrastructure and logistics. Microsoft doesn't come close to delivering the same level of NOPAT as Apple does, which explains why it trails Apple so much on FCF yield. It does have a higher NOPAT than Alphabet does. However, Microsoft's enterprise value is much larger than Alphabet's. As a result, Alphabet claims a higher FCF yield. Nvidia's main issue is that it's not in the same league in terms of free cash flow generation as Apple and Alphabet are. The chipmaker's enterprise value has also skyrocketed more this year than any of the other stocks. Don't judge these stocks by one metric Even with FCF yield, it's important to keep in mind that the dynamics for a given stock can change. For example, Amazon is now generating strong positive free cash flow after a period of producing negative free cash flow. Nvidia's free cash flow has also soared in 2023 thanks to surging demand for its graphics processing units. One of the biggest drawbacks to any investing metric is that it only tells you where a company has been, not where it's going. FCF yield won't give investors a good picture of a stock's growth prospects. Most other metrics won't either. I think that FCF yield is absolutely an important metric to consider when buying stocks. However, don't judge these high-flying $1 trillion club members (or any other stocks, for that matter) by only this one metric. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Nvidia each have growth drivers that could make them appealing to investors.

  - Título: '3 Top E-Commerce Stocks to Buy in October'
    Conteúdo: 'With trillions in spending up for grabs, these brands are well-positioned to deliver fabulous returns. Growth stocks took a big hit in the market sell-off last year, and within this group, the sector that took one of the hardest hits was online retail (e-commerce) stocks. As the market inches toward recovery in 2023 and inflation concerns ease, investors who focus on purchasing stock in leading e-commerce brands could position their portfolios for above-average returns. Part of the reason why this sector holds such potential is still in recovery mode. Another big reason is that global e-commerce spending is on track to top $6 trillion this year (up from $5.54 trillion in 2022), and eMarketer estimates it will grow to $7.4 trillion by 2025. Given all that potential e-commerce growth, here are three stocks set to benefit that you might want to consider buying in October. 1. Apple Apple (AAPL 1.48%) sees more of its total sales coming from what it sells on its Apple.com online store with each passing year. Last year, Apple.com-related revenue made up 15% of the business, according to Statista, up from about 10% in 2020. Apples installed base of devices has continued to hit new highs each year. This is fueling profitable sales of apps and subscriptions in the App Store. Over the last four years, Apples trailing 12-month revenue increased by 48%, with operating profit up 74%. Apple saw product sales weaken in recent quarters along with the global smartphone market. Wedbush analysts see pre-orders for the new iPhone 15 up by double-digit percentages over the previous model, so Apple should be well-positioned to resume growth over the next year. Apple has built a profitable business around premium hardware and software. On a trailing basis, it generated $101 billion of free cash flow on $384 billion of revenue through the June quarter. That should fund more investment in artificial intelligence (AI) to grow interest in Apples products. The stock should remain a solid investment for years to come. 2. PayPal PayPal (PYPL 0.51%) is a leading online payments provider with 431 million active customer accounts. The company increased its revenue and earnings per share at an annualized rate of 17% and 12%, respectively, over the last 10 years. Its large base of customers positions the company well for more growth and returns to shareholders. On the second-quarter earnings call, CEO Dan Schulman noted a disconnect between what management is seeing inside the business and the stocks recent performance. Indeed, revenue continued to grow this year. In the second quarter, PayPal processed 6.1 billion payment transactions, which includes the Venmo peer-to-peer payment app, for an increase of 10% over the year-ago quarter. PayPal is also seeing customers use their accounts more. Transactions per active account increased 12% year over year in the second quarter. This suggests that customers are not finding viable alternatives to PayPals feature-rich platform. The stock appears oversold trading well off its previous peak. Given the negative sentiment surrounding the stock due to slowing revenue growth over the last few years, it may take a while for the market to come around. But PayPals continued growth, especially on the bottom line where earnings per share are up 28% in the first half of 2023, should lead to solid returns off these lower share prices. 3. Amazon Amazon (AMZN 1.59%) is a no-brainer e-commerce stock to buy right now. Its the leader in the space with $538 billion in annual sales that is supported by several lucrative and complementary businesses, including advertising services, subscriptions, third-party fulfillment fees, and cloud services. The stock rallied this year mostly on the prospects for Amazons cloud business as organizations invest in AI services. But with inflation starting to come down, Amazon is well positioned for accelerating sales growth over the next few years. Amazons online store has already posted improved growth this year. Moreover, it is seeing profits explode. Operating income in the North American segment hit $3.2 billion in the second quarter, reversing a loss in the same quarter in 2022. The stock could have more room to run as management optimizes inventory placement at its fulfillment centers, which should lead to more profitable growth. Using Amazons trailing cash from operations per share, the stock looks undervalued at a price multiple of 21. This is the lowest valuation in the last 10 years, making now a great time to buy shares.'

  - Título: 'Stock Market Today: Nasdaq Soars as Bond Yields Retreat'
    Conteúdo: 'The main indexes closed higher as a big miss in the ADP payrolls report had Treasury yields pulling back from recent highs. Stocks opened higher Wednesday as bad-news-is-good-news jobs data lowered expectations for another rate hike at the next Fed meeting. Sentiment also got a lift as Treasury yields retreated, though one benchmark notably lagged behind its peers as oil prices plummeted. ADP this morning said that the U.S. added 89,000 private payrolls in September, the slowest pace of growth since January 2021 and well below economists forecasts for a gain of 150,000. Additionally, year-over-year wage growth decelerated to 5.9% from the 6% increase seen in August. "The ADP release should always be taken with a pinch of salt ahead of the U.S. jobs report on Friday and I have no doubt todays is being viewed no differently," says Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA. "If it can be replicated later this week then people will certainly sit up and take notice, but at this moment, its just another ADP number that will probably be well off the nonfarm payrolls report." Rate-hike expectations, oil prices drop While the ADP report signaled cooling in the labor department, activity in the services sector remains strong. Data from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) showed its services sector index fell to 53.6 in September from 54.5 in August, though it held above the 50 level that indicates expansion. Todays data helped lower the probability the Fed will raise interest rates by a quarter-percentage point at its November meeting. According to CME Group, futures traders are now pricing in a 20% chance for a rate hike next month, down from yesterdays reading of 28.2%. Additionally, Treasury yields retreated from their decade-plus highs, with the yield on the 2-year government note falling 9.4 basis points to 5.054% and the yield on the 10-year bond sinking 6.9 basis points to 4.733%. (A basis point = 0.01%.) This had an outsized effect on the rate-sensitive Nasdaq Composite, which rallied 1.4% to 13,236, while the broader S&P 500 rose 0.8% to 4,263. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average underperformed, adding 0.4% to 33,129 as oil major Chevron (CVX) tumbled 2.3%. The energy sector (-3.3%) took a big hit today as U.S. crude futures fell 5.6% to $84.22 per barrel, their lowest settlement in a month. In addition to Chevron, energy stocks Occidental Petroleum (OXY, -3.9%) and Exxon Mobil (XOM, -3.7%) were two of Wednesdays notable decliners. Apple gets a rare downgrade on valuation concerns In other single-stock news, Apple (AAPL) opened lower this morning before closing up 0.7% after KeyBanc analyst Brandon Nispel downgraded the tech giant for the first time in two years. Specifically, Nispel lowered his rating on AAPL stock to Sector Weight from Overweight, the equivalents of Hold and Buy, respectively, citing expectations of slowing iPhone sales in the near term. Additionally, Nispel pointed to Apples valuation as another reason for the downgrade. Although shares are down nearly 12% since late July, they are still trading at 29 times forward earnings, well above Apples five-year average of 24. "We believe in order to justify upside to shares, peak valuations need to be applied or its growth profile needs to inflect higher," the analyst wrote in a note to clients. Downgrades for Apple are rare, with the majority of Wall Street bullish on the blue chip stock. Of the 45 analysts covering AAPL tracked by S&P Global Market Intelligence, 29 say its a Strong Buy or Buy vs eight who have it at Hold and three who call it a Sell or Strong Sell. This works out to a consensus Buy recommendation.'

  - Conteúdo: Meta’s ambitious AI work likely eats up lots of data. The company may be looking to synthetics to fill that need. The social media giant is seeking to patent a system for “generating synthetic data.” As the title of this filing implies, Meta’s system creates what it calls “simulated data” to help design custom-tailored applications without relying on actual system data, as to not sacrifice privacy for “high fidelity” design. First, Meta’s system retrieves what it calls “data patterns” of content from a system or network (i.e., a social network). The system could glean these data patterns from user-generated content, including profile information and public posts such as “location information, photos, videos, audio, links, music” and more. Data patterns essentially are the characteristics of actual data, but not the data itself, aiming to “preserve certain statistical characteristics associated with the actual content” that may be vital to application or hardware development. The system also determines “indices” associated with the data patterns, or essentially a way to quantify, describe and organize them. Finally, the system uses a statistical model to generate “simulated data” associated with the content. Because the data mimics the characteristics and qualities of actual system content, this data can be used for optimization while “minimizing privacy risks.” And because the data is synthetic, it’s more easily shareable for development purposes outside of the system or network that it came from.

  - Título: 'Microsoft CEO Nadella blasts Google, shares his big AI fear'
    Conteúdo: 'Microsoft has been a leader in artificial intelligence (AI), taking it from something that was theoretical and making it very real. The company laid out its plans in a 2019 blog post that more or less predicted the future. "Just a few years ago, artificial intelligence was largely relegated to universities and research labs, a charming computer science concept with little use in mainstream business. Today, AI is being integrated into everything from your refrigerator to your favorite workout app," the company shared. Thats a sort of innocent way to frame AI which does not include the many ways the technology can go wrong. To be fair, Microsoft (MSFT) - Get Free Report has put building responsible AI-based products as its core mission which the company also spelled out in the 2019 blog post. "Our AI tools and technologies are designed to benefit everyone at every level in every organization. They are used in workplaces, home offices, academic institutions, research labs, and manufacturing facilities around the world, and they are helping everyone from scientists and salespeople to farmers, software developers, and security practitioners," the company wrote. Microsofts leaders clearly understood where AI might go wrong and the dangers it comes with. They probably foresaw how the technology could be used for everything from cheating on a college paper to replacing actors with virtual actors (and many more nefarious potential uses for deep fakes. Satya Nadella has issues with Google. Satya Nadella has transformed Microsoft since taking over for former CEO Steve Ballmer. Instead of closing the company off from its rivals, Nadella has been open to working with companies that are also competitors like Apple. The CEO, however, remains at odds with Alphabet (GOOGL) - Get Free Report and testified in a recent antitrust lawsuit against the Google operator. Geekwire shared a partial transcript of that testimony where Nadella made it clear that he believes that Alphabet uses its enormous leverage to stifle competition. (Thats a charge Alphabet obviously disputes). “This entire notion that users have choice and they go from one website to one website or one search into one search...its [completely] bogus. Theres defaults...You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google. And so therefore, with that such level of habit forming, the only way to change is by changing defaults,” he said. Nadella also believes that Alphabet sells a false narrative that OEM partners have a choice when in reality they dont. "Google has carrots and it has massive sticks...Well remove Google Play if you dont have us as the primary browser. And without Google Play, an Android phone is a brick. And so that is the type of stuff that is impossible to overcome. No OEM is going to do that,” he said. Satya Nadella shares his AI fears. Nadella also shared a surprising fear about artificial intelligence that may not be what you expected. “I worry a lot, even in spite of my enthusiasm, that there is a new angle with AI. I worry a lot that, in fact, this vicious cycle that Im trapped in can even become even more vicious because the defaults get reinforced. The publisher content can get locked in. And so if there are exclusive content deals which are happening right as we speak…all that content today, at least thats crawlable by everyone and usable by large model training, could become exclusive,” he shared. Basically, the CEO is worried that content — really knowledge — that is now available to all will become proprietary. That may not be angry robots enslaving humanity, but its a more subtle danger thats harder to guard against.'

    Conteúdo: 'We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you dont agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a companys future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a companys potential performance. Given that we are looking at Microsoft as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation weve used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.997. Beta is a measure of a stocks volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for MicrosoftStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Software market.Opportunity/nnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.hreatnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company.

  - Título: 'Is Microsoft’s OpenAI Stake Worth $100 Billion? The Case for a Mega Valuation.'
    Conteúdo: 'Amazon is investing up to $4 billion in Anthropic, a generative AI start-up co-founded by former OpenAI employees.Artificial intelligence (AI) is more than just the new buzzword on Wall Street. Companies ranging from world-class enterprises to small and medium-sized businesses are increasingly investing in the technology for fear of falling behind their competitors.To date, some of the most obvious beneficiaries of AI are Big Tech companies such as Microsoft, Alphabet, and Nvidia. Earlier this year, Microsoft committed to a multiyear investment in OpenAI, the developer of the wildly popular ChatGPT. Moreover, Alphabet has invested significantly in a company called Anthropic, which is notably co-founded by former OpenAI employees. E-commerce and cloud computing leader Amazon (AMZN 1.59%) has taken a page out of Alphabets playbook, and its the latest company to join Anthropics impressive roster of investors. Lets break down why Amazon is so keen to join the likes of Alphabet, Zoom, and Salesforce by acquiring an equity stake in this AI unicorn. A breakdown of the dealPer the terms of the deal, Amazon will invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic, giving the e-commerce leader a minority ownership stake. Anthropic has been a customer of Amazons cloud offering, Amazon Web Services (AWS), since 2021. As part of the deal, Anthropic will use AWS as its primary cloud provider. Even better, Anthropic will also be using Amazons chips to train its future AI models. This is a huge step in the right direction for Amazons machine learning roadmap. How can Amazon benefit?The cloud computing sector is dominated by Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet. Amazon holds nearly one-third of the global cloud infrastructure market, according to industry estimates from Synergy Research Group.Microsoft and Alphabet are the second and third largest providers, respectively, but growth for Amazons cloud segment has fallen behind that of its peers. Some of the slowdown can be attributed to macroeconomic factors such as inflation and fears of an economic downturn. These headwinds have forced companies to make difficult decisions, including layoffs, in an effort to reduce expenses.Unfortunately, this only explains part of the slowdown. Competition is indeed gaining steam, and Amazon is hoping to inject some new life into AWS.Beyond this competitive pressure, one of the more underappreciated aspects of the Anthropic deal is the use of Amazons chips. As it stands, the intersection of AI and semiconductors belongs to Nvidia. Now, Amazon has a chance to stake its own claim in the chip market.Does this make the stock a buy?While its difficult to quantify the benefits of the deal right now, the broader theme of Anthropics generative AI models leveraging Amazon chips and AWS could unlock an entirely new opportunity for the companys cloud operation.In the long run, cloud computing will continue to grow its share of IT budgets as businesses invest in digital transformation. While Amazon faces fierce competition in the space, the company is taking action, and this Anthropic deal could end up playing a big role in the evolution of AWS.Buying Amazon stock today in hopes that the company will soon begin to reap material benefits from Anthropic or its AI endeavors is a bit short-sighted. However, investors can use this deal as a pillar of a longer-term investment thesis for Amazon business or for exposure to AI.'

The CMA needs to show restraint,” it said. Microsoft will debut Copilot for business customers on November 1. For $30 a month, Copilot will be "your everyday AI companion," incorporating all of the data available on the web, all of your work data and what you are doing on your computer "to provide better assistance" with whatever you task may be working on, according to Microsoft.'
